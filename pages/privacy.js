              We use this information to process orders, verify payments on-chain, deliver
              products, maintain your wallet balance, provide customer support, and keep the Site
              secure.
            </Section>

            <Section title="3. Third parties">
              We use Supabase for authentication and data storage, and public BNB Smart Chain
              nodes to verify payments — both process data only as needed to provide the Site.
              Blockchain transactions themselves are public by nature and visible to anyone,
              independent of this Site.
            </Section>

            <Section title="4. Data retention">
              We keep account and order data for as long as your account is active, and as needed
              for support, fraud prevention, and legal recordkeeping afterward.
            </Section>

            <Section title="5. Your rights">
              You can ask us to access, correct, or delete your account data by contacting us
              through the channel linked on the Site — note that on-chain transaction records
              themselves cannot be deleted, as they exist on the public blockchain independent of
              us.
            </Section>

            <Section title="6. Contact">
              Reach us through the WhatsApp channel linked on the Site.
